REVISIT: The algorithm P(x) = P(x & (x - 1)) + 1 may come up as some bit algebra.
Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/

Given a non negative integer number num.
For every numbers i in the range 0 â‰¤ i â‰¤ num calculate the number of 1's in
their binary representation and return them as an array.

Example 1:

Input: 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Example 2:

Input: 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Follow up:

It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)).
But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
Space complexity should be O(n).
