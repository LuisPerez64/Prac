REVISIT: The property of these calculations being able to be relayed as graph nodes is worth reviewing.
Question: https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-division/

You are given an array of variable pairs equations and an array of real numbers values,
where equations[i] = [Ai, Bi] and values[i] represent the equation Ai / Bi = values[i].
Each Ai or Bi is a string that represents a single variable.

You are also given some queries, where queries[j] = [Cj, Dj] represents the jth query
where you must find the answer for Cj / Dj = ?.

Return the answers to all queries. If a single answer cannot be determined, return -1.0.

Note: The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will not result
in division by zero and that there is no contradiction.



Example 1:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"]], values = [2.0,3.0],
    queries = [["a","c"],["b","a"],["a","e"],["a","a"],["x","x"]]
Output: [6.00000,0.50000,-1.00000,1.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation:
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are: a / c = ?, b / a = ?, a / e = ?, a / a = ?, x / x = ?
return: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0 ]
Example 2:

Input: equations = [["a","b"],["b","c"],["bc","cd"]], values = [1.5,2.5,5.0],
    queries = [["a","c"],["c","b"],["bc","cd"],["cd","bc"]]
Output: [3.75000,0.40000,5.00000,0.20000]
Example 3:

Input: equations = [["a","b"]], values = [0.5],
    queries = [["a","b"],["b","a"],["a","c"],["x","y"]]
Output: [0.50000,2.00000,-1.00000,-1.00000]


Constraints:

1 <= equations.length <= 20
equations[i].length == 2
1 <= Ai.length, Bi.length <= 5
values.length == equations.length
0.0 < values[i] <= 20.0
1 <= queries.length <= 20
queries[i].length == 2
1 <= Cj.length, Dj.length <= 5
Ai, Bi, Cj, Dj consist of lower case English letters and digits.
