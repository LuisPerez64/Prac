Interface:
  Output: Welcome to the average calculator.
  Output: Begin input of numbers, when done input sentinel value '~' to exit 
          input operations.
  Input:  numberToBeAdded // Within a while loop break cond, sentinel value.
  Output: 'At every value input, average so far, if user wishes it to be so'
  Output: Average for _n_ values is _averageOfNValues_;
  Output: Run it all again?
  Input:  Yes or no?


Under The Hood:
  Algorithms:  
    Averaging operation: _total_ / _amountOfInputsSoFar_
    No real algorithms past this are used in the process of making this work.
  
  
Added Functionality:
  Toggle for printing out the average on every time the user inputs a number.
