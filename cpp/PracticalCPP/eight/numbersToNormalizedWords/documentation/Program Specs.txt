Program Specs:
  The program is given a number, and takes that number and prints out what the 
  number will be if you would want it to be printed out in conventional means
  ie. 99 = ninety-nine, and so forth instead of nine nine.

Interface:
  Output: Welcome to the number printing program.
  Output: Please input a number to make it come out as it is written...
  Input: __numberToBeConverted__
  Output: The number __numberToBeConverted__ is __convertedNumberString__

Classes/Objects Used: N/A

Under The Hood:
  Pseudocode: 
    Take the number that is input. Get the range it is in. 0-10, 11-99, 
    100- 1000, 1000-10000, 10000-100000, 100000-10000000. Just getting 1-1000
    working for now.
    Take the number, find its range. modulo the number by the range construct,
    after the range is found find the manner to put in the needed point into a
    string. 
    Divide it by 10 to get into the range that is below the given range at the 
    time,and recursively, iteratively however I decide to do it, go until the 
    number input dvided by 10 is 0, as an int will not hold 0.xxx.
    Print out the constructed string.
    
  Algorithms Used: 
    _inputVar_ % range / range /** to find the exact number.
    _inputVar_ / range /** to get into the range that will follow.
    It;s not so much to the point of being algorithmical, but more or less 
    sensical in nature. Returning to write this in better after the code is 
    constructed.

  Special Cases: N/A, no division by 0, no exception handling.
