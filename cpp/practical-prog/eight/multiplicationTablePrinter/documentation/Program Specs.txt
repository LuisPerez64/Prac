Program Specification:
  Write a program to print out the multiplication table.

Interface:
  Output: What range would you like to show the table for.
  Output: Lower Bound: 
  Input: _lowerBound_
  Output: Upper Bound:
  Input: _upperBound_
  Output: /** Table within that range of digits. 


Classes/Objects Used: N/A

Under The Hood:
  Pseudocode: Pseudo code is harder to write for this than the actual code...
    Take the lower bound, and increment it by as a basic multiplication table 
    would. At each incrementation, multiply it by the needed number. Print out
    a new line. Increment the multiplier by one. Do the cycle until the 
    _lowerBound_ equals _upperBound_

  Algortihms: 
    Multiplication table algorithm. Simple in and of itself.

  Functions Used: 
   runMultiplicationTablePrinter()
   printOutMultiplicationLine(int start, int end, u=int multiplier)
