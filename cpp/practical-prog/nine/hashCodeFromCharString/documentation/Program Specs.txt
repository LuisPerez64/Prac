Program Specification:
  User inputs a string, and the string is turned into a basic hash code.
  This is done by taking every one of the characters and making them into their
  integer values, and adding up all the integer values to a running total.

Interface:
  Output: Welcome to the basic hash map maker.
  Output: Please input the string to be converted:
  Input: _inputString_
  /** Do hash code operations.
  Output: The value of the input string in baic hash code manner is: "
  Output: _hashCodeValue_
  
Under The Hood:
  Pseudocode:
   Take in an input string from the user. Take that string, and iterate through
   it, taking the integer value of each character, and add it to a running 
   total. Print out the total value of all the strings that were put in.
   Extra: Find out what the possible values that were input were, by taking
          the hash code value, and printing out all possible combinations that
	  were possible to have made that given hash code value.

  Algorithms: N/A

  Functions Used:
    void runHashCodeProg(void);
    int hashCodeValueOfInputString(std::string)
