Program Speficitation:
  Write a function count(number, array, length) which counts the amount of 
  times number appearsin array. he array has length elements. The function 
  should be recursive. Write a test program to test it out.

Interface:
  Output: Welcome to the number counter program.
  Output: Begin inputting numbers into the array, runs until array's finished: 
  Input: for(array length || sentinel){} _inputNum_
  Output: Which number would you like to count instances for: 
  Input:  _numberToCheckFor_ /** Number to check for instances of.
  Output: The number _numberToCheckFor_ appears _totalNumberOfTimes_ in the
          array.
  
Under The Hood:
  Pseudocode:
   Take in the numbers that are being put into the array. Go into the point 
   where it either fills the array, or the sentinel value is met. Go through
   the array, and find the instances of the times that the number has appeared
   in the array, and return that to the user.

  Algorithm:
   Array traversal, array manipulation. No real algorithms.

  Functions Used:
   void runNumberCounter(void);
   int numberOfTimesNumberAppears(int number, int array[], int length);
