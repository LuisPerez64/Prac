Program Specification: 
 Write a function that takes in two strings. Takes those two strings and if the
 second string is a compound function, with the first string being a part of it
 and produces a boolean based on the result of that to the caller.

Interface:
 Output: Welcome to the string comparison poin function. 
 Output: Input the first string:
 Input: _stringOne_
 Output: Input the second string:
 Input: _stringTwo_
 Output: if{} /* True: _stringTwo_ Is a compound string of the first string.
 	      /* False: _stringTwo_ Is not "^^"
 
Under The Hood:
  Pseudocode: 
   If the second string is shorter than the first then skip straight through, 
   return false. Run through the strings, comparing each character, if they at
   any point deviate, based on the length of the first string, then return 
   false, else return true.

  Algorithm:
   String comparison through iteration.
 
  Functions Used:
   void runStringComparison(void);
   bool stringBeginsFunction(std::string stringOne, std::string stringTwo);
