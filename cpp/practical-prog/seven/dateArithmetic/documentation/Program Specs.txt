Date Arithmetic Calculator
Basic point: Takes in two dates from the user, and outputs the number of days
      	     that seperates those dates.
Algorithms Used:
	   Year Calculations:
		 Leap Year ~~ 364 Days ~ Formula for that below
	   	    (var%4 == 0 and (var%100 != 0) || var%400 == 0)    
	   	 Non Leap Year ~~ 365 Days

	   Month Calculations: 	 
		 Months with 30 Days (April(4) | June(6) | September(9) |
		 	     	      November(11) )
	         Months with 31 Days (Jan(1) | May(3) | Mar(5) | July(7) |
		 	     	      Aug(8) | Oct(10) | Dec(12) )
	         Months with Var Days (Leap Year 29 | Normal Year 28)

          Total Calculation:
	  	Go from first year to last year.
		If begin month is less than end month then not full year, else
		   do basic arithmetic for the year. Adding leap years if
		   needed.
		Then begin by subtracting days passed from the given month, and
		add the days afterwards.
