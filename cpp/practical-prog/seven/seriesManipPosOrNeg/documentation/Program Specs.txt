Program Specs for Series Manipulation Positive Negative Counter.
 The program is given a list of numbers, and then subsequently counts how many 
 of the numbers are positive and how many of the numbers that are input are
 negative.

Interface:
   Output: How many numbers would you like to validate?: 
   Input: numberOfVariables;
   Output: Random numbers generated.
   Output: From _numberOfVariables_ Numbers, there are __ positive __ negatives
            
Under the Hood:
   Simple counter objects for positive and negative numbers.
   Birng in a vector, push_back as much as is specified by the user, and then
   count out the needed points by iterating through the vector, and counting 
   the negative and positive numbers that have occured within it.

Algorithms:
   None really. Bringing in the needed vector container, bringing in the stdlib
   for the random function, or may integrate the random library that is new to 
   the C++11 Library past. Haven't really used it as of yet though so maybe
   this is the perfect manner to do it forward.
