Overhead Specification:
  A series transmission line cna transmit 960 bytes per second. Write a program
  that will calculate how long it will take to send a file, given the file's
  size, input from the user.

Interface:
   Output: Input the speed of the transmission, in bytes per second:
   Input: bytesPerSecond
   Output: How big is the file that will be getting sent, in MB
   Input: sizeOfFile
   Output: Given the file size of __ MB it would take 
   Output: Print out Years/Months/Weeks/Days/Hours/Minutes/Seconds

Under The Hood:
   Convert the MB file into bytes, unsigned long int should be enough.
   Divide that value by bytesPerSecond to attain the amount of time it'd take
     in seconds to transmit that
   Run through a basic conversion point, outlining this change by max numbers
   If it's past a year bring in the value of the year->months->weeks->days
     ->hours->minutes->seconds
   Output only the values that are past 0 to the user.

   Wrap this around a while loop, hold a function that makes everything work as
     they ned to. 
   Values to be used in the conversions.
     Year 365 Days
     Month 30 Days ~~ Baseline point it 30.4 Days evenly split
     Week 7 Days
     Day 24 Hours
     Hours 60 Minutes
     Minutes 60 Seconds
