Preliminary Users' Specification
July 20, 2015 Luis Perez

The program will do the basic mathematical functions (+. -, *, /)
The program begins with the result register as 0, and updates it as the 
 user inputs needed points into it ie:

Result: 0
Enter Operator and Number: + 123
Result: 123
Enter Operator and Number: - 23
Result: 100
Enter Operator and Number: - 101
Result: -1

******************************** Update ******************************
Need a way to exit the program:
  Added operator 'q' to quit
What happens if you divide by 0:
  Program does not allow this division to happen. Produc error await user input
  again. Does not change result.
